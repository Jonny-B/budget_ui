This is still very much a work in progress. Be kind.

It might error the first time you visit. A refresh will fix it. Heroku needs to spin up a new node and it times out. 

1. Click "Log in"
2. Sign up
3. Click "Link Account Transactions" and continue
4. Select any bank (it's a test mode so it's fake data)
5. Username user_good | Password pass_good
6. If transactions don't appear refresh
